#### Image cropper for personal use (might not work with your pdfs)
<b>Requires [pdfimages](https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html) on the path to work properly</b>
It's thought just for my workflow so is error prone at the moment.

#### Example usage with the provided sample pdf
This will open the image cropper window for the single page the pdf has,
after that you can create crop rectangles with right click and change their
color by left clicking those rectangles, to save the crops just close the
window
```shell
cargo r -- input.pdf
```
